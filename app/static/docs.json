"text": "According to an article in EL WATAN of 28 February, the slaying of the GIA members on 27 February was not only \"a brilliant success for the forces of order but also a significant blow to the organization and structure of the groups.\"  The deaths of El-Afghani and his followers, considered \"the bloodiest and the most radical of the fundamentalist armed groups within the movement,\" was viewed as a turning point in a three-year struggle against them. According to EL WATAN, it is reasonable to think that a considerable break in GIA activity can be expected, although the paper did not rule out retaliatory acts by surviving group members.  El-Afghani's refusal to support dialogue between the FIS and the government made his wing of the GIA a \"serious barrier to dialogue.\" Now, according to EL WATAN, \"his disappearance should logically open channels for dialogue.\"  Given the GIA's threats under their leader to kill all who engaged in any kind of negotiations with the government, EL WATAN asserted that his death was probably a priority and a prerequisite for any negotiations between the FIS and the government. An article in the 28 February LIBERTE interpreted the police operation as an indication that President Liamine Zeroual is determined to combat violence:  \"The successful attack demonstrated that the authorities not only had the intention of not easing up on armed groups, but when necessary also had the means to attack 'intimidation'.\"  According to the article, the incident will \"have a great effect on government-FIS negotiations,\" given El- Afghani's resistance to dialogue.  However, the LIBERTE article also predicted that the government would harden its position that eliminating violence is of primary importance.  The article also speculates that the government is still in the process of recovery after having recently appointed a new president.",

"text": "There has been a lot of instability in the zone. A Palestinian gunman shot five soldiers at a bus stop in Israel on Thursday. He was later killed himself. Two Arab workers also stabbed and badly wounded a Jewish settler on the Gaza Strip, authorities said. The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas warned Thursday 7 April it will soon fire rockets at Israeli homes and urged Palestinians to stock up with food for war. The threat in a letter distributed in the occupied areas came a day after a suicide bomber from the Hamas armed wing 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam killed seven Israelis and wounded 45 at Afula. And this is not a new event. That was just the first of five major attacks to come on Israeli targets in revenge for the Hebron mosque massacre of 30 Moslems by a Jewish settlers on February 25, Hamas said. \"We are calling on settlers to evacuate now so no one will be able to accuse us of killing civilians,\" the letter said. \"Our al-Qassam units will shell their homes with rockets that we own. Everyone knows we keep our word.\"   Hamas called on \"shopkeepers and the people to stock up with food because an atmosphere of war will prevail in the near future.\"   The statement also urged PLO chairman to halt talks with Israel for one year. \"Our units will force Israeli leaders to evacuate their soldiers and settlers from Gaza, Jericho and Hebron without any conditions as a first step to saving the whole of the West Bank and strip,\" Hamas said. \"We will guarantee the president's position if he agrees\". The letter noted that 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam waited until the traditional day of mourning 40 days after the Hebron slaughter to carry out the bombing in northern Israel. The fighting continues.",

On the problem in the entire territory, and in particular in the capital, the security members studied the issue in all its aspects and found that it was a priority concern for the country's leaders and the population. The elder council sadly noted that if peace and security were not restored swiftly, the country would inexorably slip into perdition.  The council expressed its deep sympathy for the victims of this destructive madness, which has befallen our dear motherland since the coup attempt in which the elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, was killed.   In order to restore security and peace in the country, it was heard that the National Security Council proposed to the government the following:   First, all the institutions of the Republic and political and moral leaders of society must permanently speak the language of peace and reconciliation. The spirit of solidarity must be revived and reinforced so that the people, irrespective of their ethnic affiliations, can cultivate a spirit of mutual help in the face of danger, fighting together against criminals and all types of wrongdoers, and reject the enticement of those who want to once more drag them into ethnic violence and vengeance.   Second, all the institutions charged with public order, whether magistrates, administrative leaders or security forces, must carry out their tasks with discipline, work in permanent consultation, and act with the utmost firmness to neutralize all troublemakers and all wrongdoers who kill, loot, and destroy. In this respect, the government must establish a crisis committee which will meet daily to assess the situation, identify those responsible for the tragic events we are experiencing, propose strategies for fighting them, and report daily to the president of the Republic. The crisis committee will include the minister of state for the interior and public security, the minister of national defence, the minister of justice, and the general administrator in charge of national documentation and immigration.",

"text": "Existing movements are still active. These pose a potential danger. White supremacists demonstrated intent to harm their traditional targets. However, although many had a clear hatred directed toward these communities, very few committed acts of violence or terrorism. White supremacists place the highest target value on African-Americans, Jews, homosexuals, and illegal immigrants. For example, in November 2005 KKK member Daniel James Schertz was sentenced to 170 months in federal prison for planning to blow up buses carrying Mexican and Haitian migrant workers. Elements of the US government are considered to be complicit in an alleged Zionist-inspired plot against white Americans. Target value in the white supremacist movement is also driven by imagery that increases the meaning of individual acts. In addition to receiving general approval within the movement, an attack against a single minority, Jewish synagogue, or government entity can reverberate-especially among Christian Identity adherents-as a prediction of an anticipated final violent conflict between the group and their enemies. Within white supremacy groups, distrust and paranoia are common due to suspicions of law enforcement infiltration and observation. Because of these fears, as well as the belief in so-called \"leaderless resistance\" tactics, white supremacist groups advise members to distance themselves from group links prior to committing violent acts. The potential for arrest offers little warning to skinheads, who in part define group identity and individual status by violent actions against minorities. This is often due to the mixture of alcohol abuse and large group settings. These can sometimes create a feeling of anonymity conducive to engaging in violence. These factors, combined with a predisposed hatred of minorities, often lead to violent attacks. Offenders within the movement have committed fatal shooting sprees and considered major bombings in the past. These remain concerns going forward.",

"text": "Evoking embers as a principal source of subsequent home destruction is hardly new, however, the realization that the accumulation of fire sources might exhibit a simple linear function of distance downwind from the initial ignition location is. In the two-level ember-attack model, the probability of home destruction per ember 'hit' is low relative to that of undergrowth. Collectively, three features of the pattern of house fatalities - the overall linearity, clustering at neighbourhoods, and binary outcomes observed at an individual level - comprise a fire impact model for at-risk homes. Two fatalities were attributed to the fires, while at least 248 dwellings and other buildings were destroyed; with 193 properties destroyed and 109 damaged in some of the surrounding suburbs. Two extensive residential suburbs, each possessing one or two flanks that experienced rampant fire penetration as well as having reasonably large samples of destroyed homes had fine-grained spatial resolution pre- and post-fire satellite images, aerial photographs and photographs taken during site inspections used to manually identify locations (centroids) of destroyed homes. Normal operations in some regions were affected by the fires, with the significant damage limiting access and recovery efforts. Transport across the state was severely affected at its peak on 23 October, as a large majority of arterial roads and highways were closed in both directions as a result of the fires. Police continued to investigate the origins of the fires, with the death toll rising to at least three. Several more individuals were still considered missing, however the instability of the region hampered rescue efforts. There was ongoing concern for the safety and security of emergency service workers and personnel as they continued to monitor the threat. The majority of homes were destroyed beyond a separation distance of 40 m, suggesting the main cause of home ignition was airborne embers rather than direct flame contact or radiant heat.",

Johnson, whom I have known for a decade since she attended Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, experienced this week's incident in a controlled yet unconventional environment as well -- an elevator. Even though of a moderate magnitude, the event was one of the most destructive in Japan, causing extreme damage in Kobe city and its surrounding area, close to the northern edge of the Osaka basin. The area of the highest intensity lies mainly in a densely populated part of Kobe. Johnson had posted on her Facebook page to let friends and family in the United States know that she was fine. Her cat was upset by the quake and aftershocks, she said, but otherwise, they rode it all out fairly well. Johnson lives on the Naval base and didn't have to contest the local traffic after everything began closing because of the earthquake and the aftershocks due to safety and power limitations. \"After I got to work, there were the two large aftershocks, and they evacuated the building both times. Most people were allowed to go home shortly after, so traffic on base got pretty bad, for a while\" she wrote. Johnson shared her story about the incident through Facebook private message over the Internet. Near-source strong ground motions from the event, recorded at different sites in the city, and analysis of the damage to the structures show that the damage can be attributed to extremely large ground velocities.

The two occupants relied on medical equipment which may have stopped working when their residence lost power. Police said they would investigate the deaths and prepare a report for the coroner, with their current line of inquiries being predominantly focused towards the electronic medical equipment found inside. More than fifteen thousand homes were without power following the event that also brought down trees and damaged several houses. On Ethelwyn Street in Hilton, residents told of hearing a loud bang before they lost power and strong winds ripped their properties apart. Several properties are without roofs and fences, trees and snapped power poles are strewn over the road. Stephen Howarth had the windows of his home smashed in. \"There was an almighty bang and I knew what it was straight away. I couldn't get to the doors and windows to open then in time before they exploded outwards with the pressure,\" he said. \"We've found things in the garden that were in the house.\" Mr Howarth said sheet metal from a nearby factory was blown on to his car, damaging it, and that fellow residents from the neighbourhood were baffled how homes in neighbouring streets had been untouched. \"It's only on this street, we've all been hit,\" he said. Noel Nicholas told of how he bunkered down on the first floor of his property, on the corner of Ethelwyn and Clarke Streets in order to reduce his exposure to the elements. The roof of his home has disappeared, leaving only two bedrooms covered, and the windows of the home have also been smashed and fences and the garage destroyed. \"There was an almighty explosion and that's when we knew we were in trouble,\" he said. Mr Nicholas was emotional when he told of how the family home was now uninhabitable. He has lived in the property for 45 years. \"I'm just devastated and I just can't believe how this happened so quickly. Just seconds and it all was gone,\" Mr Nicholas said.",

"text": "In the first place, death tolls have not decreased dramatically in response to improved mitigation and with regard to prediction, the desire for basic information in advance of the impact of extreme events has never been greater than it is currently. But achievements, opportunities and future prospects vary greatly from one geophysical agent to another and prediction, warning and forecasting have improved markedly with respect to drought. On the other hand, 20 years ago the prospects for earthquake prediction looked bright, but despite massive investment little has been achieved. Routine short-term prediction is not possible, though some vulnerable processes can be shut down rapidly as the earth begins to shake: for example, the very fast-running Japanese Shinkansen trains have such a system. The situation is much more straightforward regarding the prediction of floods and, in many cases, also of volcanic eruptions, but in both cases the utility of predictions depends heavily on the level of investment and commitment by the authorities. The net result is that there has been a general lack of holistic analyses that treat hazard, risk and disaster as integrated phenomena as many links between the various aspects of them remain poorly understood, including the connections between culture and architecture, structural design and social behaviour, and land use and the application of technology. These shortcomings illustrate the difficulty of bridging the yawning gap between physical and humanistic disciplines, despite the self-evident fact that behaviour, culture and perception govern the way that purely scientific findings are interpreted and the manner in which technology is used to combat the threat of disaster. Trends such as these are very difficult to summarise, not least because social and economic polarisation have made some of the tendencies rather contradictory. In essence, however, trends in disaster have mirrored those that have occurred in society and polarisation has characterised both, and it has been exacerbated by the industrialised countries' reluctance adequately to share new resources for disaster mitigation, including technology, expertise and often also financial resources.

"text": "If the six and eight shader configuration are unbalanced in terms of bandwidth per shader unit the trial should show an improvement in performance when the additional bandwidth is provided. In modern units the number of 32-bit memory channels ranges from 1 in the lower-end segments to in the high-end implementations of the architecture. More than 4 channels add a large number of extra pins in the package and is too expensive to implement with current technology. Therefore for a high end architecture the offered bandwidth can only be modified by changing the memory frequency. Modern units allow running the memory subsystem with a different, faster, clock than the pipeline to provide more than 64 bytes per cycle to the unit pipeline. However our current implementation of the simulator only supports running the memory subsystem at the same frequency as the existing pipeline. For this reason we are limited to increasing the number of channels in order to simulate an increase in memory bandwidth. There has been visible improvement of adding 1 and 2 additional memory channels, normalized to the non unified two shader 1-way architecture. The bandwidth is increased by 25% and 50% and goes from 64 to 80 and 96 bytes per cycle. The proposal demonstrates that the 6 and 8 shader configurations are limited by memory as the increase in bandwidth produces a 7% to14% increase in performance. In this high bandwidth scenario the 8 shader configurations deliver more than a threefold improvement over the base architecture.",

"text": "An error in this heuristic might result in a deviation from the most optimal path, which could incur greater complexity and run time due to the expansion of nodes other than the minimal required to reach the goal. Considerable research has been conducted into the effects of heuristic error, and how analysing the accuracy of the heuristics used may be able to predict the effectiveness of the algorithm. Pohl discussed the importance of error analysis as a theoretical tool, applying worst case error analysis to tree search spaces and elaborating on previous work on the concepts of error and its effects on search within heuristics in order to answer the question, \"given all possible inputs conforming to a problem statement what is the most effort the algorithm will require for any input in this set\". Pohl combined both a forward and backward search using Heuristic Path Algorithm (HPA), under the belief that two searches roughly half the depth of a single longer search saves computational cost. These results were in favour of Pohl's earlier empirical results, with bi-directional search in tree spaces being almost twice as expensive as the uni-directional counterpart. Ultimately it suggests that heuristic search algorithms like A* require a linear number of node expansions when applied in tree search domains, as the bi-directional searches expanded a comparable number of nodes to the uni-directional search. There is an assumption that in tree search spaces, the branching factor is constant, there is only a single goal state and there are no transpositions, but in this context, almost-perfect heuristics are defined as h*(n) - c, whereby an additive constant c is what differs from the perfect heuristic of h*(n) for a node n. However, Pohl and Helmert & Roger focused on worst case results, with Pohl subsequently noting that the results may not be relevant to performance in the average case. ",

"text": "There are a few competing ideas in this field. Compared to the shared-null configuration, shared-nothing clusters protect against the failure of a server. The basic form of the shared-nothing cluster was compared to the protection of a file server against failure. It shows two shared-nothing clusters each with two servers. Shared-nothing clusters can be differentiated into active/active and active/passive configurations. In the active/active configuration, applications run on both computers; for example, the computers 'server 1' and 'server 2' can each export a file system. If one of the two computers fails, the other computer takes over the tasks of the failed computer in addition to its own. This taking over of the applications of the failed server can lead to performance jams in active/active configurations. The active/passive configuration can help in this situation. In this approach the application runs only on the primary server, the second computer does nothing in normal operation. It is exclusively there to take over the applications of the primary server if this fails. In this case, the stand-by server takes over its tasks (Figure 6.27, bottom).Some examples show that shared-nothing clusters with only two servers are fairly fixed. More flexibility is offered by shared-nothing clusters with more than two servers. This is often-called enhanced shared-nothing clusters. Current shared-nothing cluster software supports shared-nothing clusters with several dozens of computers. Earlier research show the use of an enhanced shared-nothing cluster for static load distribution. During day when the system is busy, three different servers each export two file systems. At night, access to the data is still needed; however, a single server can manage the load for the six file systems. The two other servers are freed up for other tasks in this period (data mining, batch processes, back-up, maintenance). Further work can investigate these ideas.",

"text": "The common idea behind the proposals of the second type was to distinguish among all models of a program a collection of intended models rather than a single one. The class of supported models was introduced by Clark and, almost ten years later, Gelfond and Lifschitz fine-tuned Clark's approach and defined the class of stable models as candidates for intended models of logic programs with negation. The difficulty of fitting logic programming with stable model semantics into the paradigm of Horn logic programming, combined with an intuitive appeal of stable models, makes us believe that the place of stable model semantics in logic programming must be re-examined. To this end, we propose below an alternative paradigm to that of the Horn logic programming, a paradigm consistent with the properties of stable models and we will refer to it as stable logic programming or, SLP for short. While stable logic programming is in many aspects different from Horn logic programming, at the most universal level it shares with it the key feature of separation of logic from control. Consequently, as other logic programming formalisms, stable logic programming is declarative in that the programmer specifies the problem at hand as a logic program. This program is then processed by a uniform control mechanism, thus solving the original problem. The differences are in the syntax and semantic, and it are these differences that affect the control mechanism (it is no longer the SLD resolution), as well as the expressive power of stable logic programming and the corresponding programming methodology. We argue that the resulting logic programming system is well-attuned to problems in the class NP, has a well-defined domain of applications, and an emerging methodology of programming. We point out that what makes the whole approach viable is recent progress in implementations of algorithms to compute stable models of propositional logic programs.",

Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council and the strong support of the public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments, banks and finance companies at various levels in the banking system have persistently cracked down on economic crimes; carried out first the activities of \"education, cleanup, and rectification\" and then the work of \"two preventions and one safeguard\" -- which was mainly for \"preventing fraud and theft, and safeguarding the security of funds in banks\" -- and scoring some successes since the latter half of 1991.   A spokesman said: At present, criminal activities, such as financial fraud, have become a noticeable problem for the banking system. Cadres, staff, and workers of banking departments at all levels must conscientiously enhance their sense of responsibility for protecting state property and safeguarding state interests; strictly implement the state's banking laws, regulations, and rules; and try hard to improve their political and professional caliber, to make due efforts to guarantee a normal banking order for the state.

Chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko told ITAR-TASS that \"any politician should strive for increased combat readiness of the armed forces, and all means are important in this respect, including a possibility to interact with other armed forces\". In his opinion, the drill should be held, but the forces are outraged with \"the Yankee stepping on Russian soil\".   Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev thinks the same, yet signalling that the Totsk drill would be is symbolic as it will include only 200 servicemen on each side and a small quantity of materiel.   The aim of the drill is to practice the organization of evacuation of wounded and delivery of humanitarian aid. \"We must hold the drill for the sake of those we are striving to protect,\" said Grachev.",

The experience of Western firms testifies to the fact that the treatment of 1 cubic meter of polluted soil cost 700-900 German marks. Another complex problem for us is the detoxification of liquid rocket fuel and oxidizers. $100 million, which is to be allotted to assist us, will not suffice to resolve even a single environmental problem. They must be removed from the territory of the Republic by some means. Russia refuses to accept such shipments. On the other hand, it is known that literally a spoonful of such rocket fuel can poison the entire water table. As of today, there is no other technology for utilizing toxic fuel other than burning it. However, burning costs a lot of money, as well. The German firm \"Buk\" has implemented a system for burning solid rocket fuel -- it cost hundreds of millions of marks.  Taking into account our cheap labor force and certain deviations from environmental norms, experts estimate that the destruction of our tanks, BMP personal carriers, and aircraft will cost us $33 million.  Excuse me, but Lithuania or Latvia have no tanks at all. These countries would probably like to buy them. Is it not better to sell our tanks to them, regardless of how low the price may be? That is a justified question. This could be possible if a more far-sighted policy were adopted during the negotiating process. It was agreed that we would destroy them -- and we should do just that. An inspection commission takes into account only those pieces of equipment that are brought into a state of uselessness and cannot be updated or restored. There is also an agreement allowing us to reequip a certain number of BMP personal carriers and tanks for utilization in the national economy. Specialists at the 140th Tank Repair Plant have already prepared drafts and models of fire engines which are fairly effective in putting out forest fires. There are also projects for installing telescopic cranes on tank or BMP undercarriages, as well as numerous other ideas. However, taking into account the short service life of a tank engine or its \"voracity,\" such a project cannot be competitive.",

The first is direct saturation, by which the capacity of a soil or sediment for toxic chemicals becomes exhausted. The second way to trigger a time bomb is through a fundamental change in a chemical property of the substrate that reduces its capacity to adsorb (or keep adsorbed) toxic materials. With respect to dredged material, the most important processes that can cause a release of heavy metals are the oxidation of anoxic sediments. Heavy metal mobility is of major concern in ecological evaluations, especially in systems involving solid-solution interactions as it is important to know how heavy metal mobility is influenced by geochemical processes. Besides the information on actual heavy metal mobility, predictions about the long-term behaviour of pollutants are necessary to perform a risk assessment. Therefore, the capacity controlling parameters (CCP's) have to be taken into account since they control the geochemical and microbiological processes that determine the fate of pollutants in soils and sediments. CEC (cation exchange capacity), pH, redox potential, soil organic matter, salinity and microbiological activity are the CCP's of soils and sediments for heavy metals. With respect to heavy metals, there are two modes in which saturation of soils and sediments occur, with subsequent triggering of chemical time bombs. The first is direct saturation, by which the capacity of a soil or sediment for toxic chemicals becomes exhausted. The second way to trigger a time bomb is through a fundamental change in a chemical property of the substrate that reduces its capacity to adsorb (or keep adsorbed) toxic materials. Because of its important load of heavy metals, the considerable pH-decrease upon oxidation and its rather low capacity to bind heavy metals, the sediment from the Kogbeek is an obvious example of a chemical time bomb.",

"text": "More recently, incubus attacks have also been identified as an entity, distinct from nightmares, and as first cousins to somnambulism. The overall syndrome fits comfortably as an high profile entity within the 'parasomnias' group of disorders with characteristic polysomnographic status (F 51.3 and F 51.4, ICD10). Within both variants of the syndrome, the behaviour classically erupts out of deep (stage 3/4) non-rapid eye movement sleep (non-REM) in the first or second sleep cycle. Some previous figures show respectively, a normal hypnogram and one characteristic of the syndrome. Sleepwalking may be the only feature of the syndrome, as may a night terror. Alternatively, events that start as night terrors may spill over into sleepwalking. In both conditions the individual is unaware of the fullness of their surroundings and is totally focused on their concern or activity. The movements may be rather clumsy and only semi-purposeful but can be forceful. Return to sleep can occur without full awakening and then there will be no memory of the event the next day. If waking does occur it can be prolonged but not necessarily so. Some habitual adult sleepwalkers are only aware that walking has occurred because they subsequently find that objects in their room are rearranged, etc. Traditionally, night terrors are said to be relatively contentless. The individual wakens with a start, may scream or gasp and looks terrified. In contrast, nightmares more commonly erupt later in the night and out of REM sleep. Nightmares are considered to be frightening dreams that waken the individual and are characterised by vivid mental content. However, some of these distinctions may not be so absolute, and classical night terrors can also have vivid content. So long as awareness remains restricted the individual remains totally identified with his or her frightening experience and cannot be reassured. ",

Where would you spend it? For her and for me, the challenge is the same: how can we do the most for the greatest number with the resources we have. During our discussions on this question, we read an article about the millions of children who were dying every year in poor countries from diseases that we had long ago made harmless in this country. Diseases such as measles, malaria, pneumonia, hepatitis B, and yellow fever. One disease I had never even heard of, rotavirus, was killing half a million kids each year - none of them in the United States. We were shocked and we had just assumed that if millions of children were dying and they could be saved, the world would make it a priority to discover and deliver the medicines to save them. But it did not. For under a dollar, there were interventions that could save lives that just weren't being delivered. If you believe that every life has equal value, it's revolting to learn that some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not. We said to ourselves: \"This can't be true. But if it is true, it deserves to be the priority of our mission.\" So we began our work in the same way anyone here would begin it. We asked: \"How could the world let these children die?\" The answer is simple, and harsh. The market did not reward saving the lives of these children, and governments did not subsidize it. So the children died because their mothers and their fathers had no power in the market and no voice in the system.",

Toyota Motor Corp.'s sales offices in Japan have one-tenth the computers per employee that its own U.S. offices do; over the next five years, it is aiming for rough parity. Within a year, Kao Corp., a major cosmetics company, plans to eliminate 1,000 clerical jobs by putting on a central computer network some work, such as credit reports, currently performed in 22 separate offices.    By increasing the number of PCs it uses from 66 to 1,000, Omron Tateishi Electronics Co., of Kyoto, hopes not only to make certain tasks easier but also to transform the way the company is run. \"Managers have long been those who supervise their subordinates so orders would be properly acted on,\" a spokesman says. \"But new managers will have to be creators and innovators . . . and for that purpose it is necessary to create an environment where information from both inside and outside the company can be reached easily, and also shared.\"    Meanwhile, more computer makers now are competing for the new business. Seiko Epson Corp., a newcomer to the industry, fought off a legal challenge and started selling NEC clones last year. It has won about 15% of the retail PC market. Sony Corp., which temporarily dropped out of the PC business three years ago, started selling its work station in 1987 and quickly became the leading Japanese company in that market.    In a country where elbow room is scarce, laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry's future growth. Toshiba Corp. busted open that sector this summer with a notebook-sized machine that retails for less than 200,000 yen (under $1,500) -- one of the smallest, cheapest PCs available in the country. Fujitsu Ltd. is lavishing the most expensive promotion campaign in its history -- including a 100,000-guest bash at Tokyo Dome -- for its sophisticated sound/graphics FM Towns machine, which it advertises for everything from balancing the family checkbook to practicing karaoke, bar singing.",

On a smaller scale, AWLA offers a safekeeping program which will take care of pets for two weeks if a family is going through a hardship like a house fire, according to McKeel. This allows for a pet to be taken care of while a family puts the pieces of their life back together, and the service is available to residents of Arlington and Falls Church.

But I found, to my moral and intellectual dismay, that they were taking advantage of my very innocence. This innocence had transformed my helplessness into passivity, which constituted an open invitation for them to do violence to my body. I saw, too, that the reason I had fallen into this situation in the first place was my hopelessness and sense of defeatism...I could see in the apparently innocent people around me in the sanatorium that passively accepting their powerlessness in the face of the condition meant dying. Not until I developed some \"fight\", some sense of personal responsibility for the fact that it was I who had suffered this condition, an assertion of my own will to live, did I make lasting progress. This disease occurred not simply because I overworked, or ran athwart some bugs, but because I was trying to be something I wasn't. I was living as the \"great extrovert\", running here and there, doing three jobs at once, and leaving undeveloped and unused the side of me which would contemplate, would read and think and \"invite my soul\" rather than rushing and working at full speed.

Shortly after taking office, the President therefore ordered a thorough review of federal efforts to defend the U.S. information and communications infrastructure.  This is coupled with a need for the development of a comprehensive approach to securing America's digital infrastructure.  Intrusion Detection Systems using passive sensors form a vital part of U.S. Government network defenses by identifying when unauthorized users attempt to gain access to those networks. DHS is deploying signature-based sensors capable of inspecting Internet traffic entering Federal systems for unauthorized accesses and malicious content. The EINSTEIN 2 capability enables analysis of network flow information to identify potential malicious activity while conducting automatic full packet inspection of traffic entering or exiting U.S. Government networks for malicious activity using signature-based intrusion detection technology. Associated with this investment in technology is a parallel investment in manpower with the expertise required to accomplish expanded network security mission. EINSTEIN 2 is capable of alerting US-CERT in real time to the presence of potentially harmful activity in federal network traffic and provides correlation and visualization of the derived data. Due to the capabilities within EINSTEIN 2, US-CERT analysts have a greatly improved understanding of the network environment and an increased ability to address the weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Federal network security. As a result, US-CERT has greater situational awareness and can more effectively develop and more readily share security relevant information with network defenders across the U.S. Government. They can also collaborate with security professionals in the private sector and the American public. These CNCI initiatives will play a key role in supporting the achievement of many of the key recommendations of President Obama's Cyberspace Policy Review.",

All would likely place these subsistence needs above any threat currently on the horizon, foreign or domestic. However, it is leaders who define the priorities for government policy and expenditures in dealing with what they perceive as the greatest threats to the country and its citizens. Such definitions of security generally arise as narratives developed in the course or aftermath of major international attacks or threats of attack. Historical turning points in these narratives over the last hundred years include, for example, the German attacks on U.S. shipping that provoked the country into World War I; the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that plunged the United States into World War II; the Berlin crisis, Korean War, and Soviet nuclear tests that intensified the Cold War. Whether or not all Americans agreed with the security rationales their leaders offered at those times, they provided bold assessments of the threats confronting the country, which gained wide acceptance. Each narrative was a necessary, and apparently sufficient, political basis to enlist political support for executive orders, policies, legislation, appropriations, treaties, and other international commitments that were consistent with the leaders' justifications. At present there is no reasonable prospect that U.S. leaders would create a security narrative focused on the cumulative threats from an overstressed planet. To mobilize popular support for the major initiatives necessary to reduce foreseeable risks, U.S. leaders would eventually have to shift their characterizations of such threats from environmental to existential and from futuristic (after 2050) to imminent (before 2020). That shift is unlikely until Americans experience a pattern of severe crises that would shift popular perceptions and political attitudes in decisively different directions. ",

"text": "International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines include an optional mechanism for authenticating and encrypting passport-to-reader communications. The conceptual notion is that a reader initially makes optical contact with a passport, and scans the name, date of birth, and passport number in order to derive a cryptographic key K with two functions: it allows the passport to establish that it is talking to a legitimate reader before releasing RFID tag information; and it is used to encrypt all data transmitted between the passport and the reader. Once a reader knows the key K, however, there is no mechanism for revoking access, and a passport holder traveling to a foreign country gives that country's Customs agents the ability to scan his or her passport in perpetuity. Further, we find that the cryptography relied upon by the ICAO standard itself has some minor flaws; the entropy of the keys is too small, with the ICAO technical report warning that the entropy of the key is at most 56 bits. Advocates of biometric authentication systems sometimes suggest that secrecy is not important to the integrity of such systems. The fact that an image of an individual's fingerprints is made public, for instance, does not preclude verification of said individual's identity; comparison of the public image with the prints on her hands should still in principle establish her identity. This is all the more true when such comparison takes place in a secure environment like an airport, where physical spoofing might seem difficult to achieve. At first glance, secrecy would seem particularly superfluous in the US-VISIT initiative and first deployments of ICAO passports, largely because the globally interoperable biometric, as mentioned above, is face recognition. Thus the biometric image stored in passports will be headshots, which is in some sense public information to begin with. Data secrecy in biometric systems, however, is a subtle issue.",

Similar to general physical distribution systems, relief distribution systems also consist of three separate parts: demand, supply, and transportation. The collection points of commodities in non-devastated areas play the role of supply, while the demand points are the devastated areas where relief is provided to victims who play the role of customers. Although the importance of objective 3 is known to be higher than those of the other two objectives, the weight relationship among these three objectives cannot be clearly defined. As a result, fuzzy multi-objective linear programming of max-min operation has been employed to re-write the mathematical equation for resolution. Thus, after the resolution for a single objective has been conducted to establish a multi-objective pay-off table, the membership function of the optimal value and the worst value of each of the objectives can be then be found. Since objective 3 is the maximization of the least satisfaction, its ideal value must be that the relief will be evenly distributed to each of the demand points regardless of cost. Therefore, the value of the ceiling limit (upper boundary) of objective 3 should be determined, and every kind of the relief items among all of the relief demand points in every period will suffice. Within the systems, the most important purpose will be to satisfy the current needs of the surviving victims as much as possible as well as reduce the damage of aftershocks. As understood, considerations of time and money are not the ultimate aims but merely soft constraints in order to ensure that resources are utilized effectively.

Furthermore, by working closely with IT solutions provider DigiCorp, the Salvation Army was able to fully recover its 500 GB disks to new servers. Although the building required significant repair work after the flood, Thorne was able to start restoring the organization's financial application and SQL data. \"The data was ready, but the facility was not,\" Thorne said. \"For once, IT was ahead of operations.\" Within 24 hours, desks were ready and normal business operations continued in the contingency facility while the data center was being decontaminated.

Yet each disaster would create the need not only for \"humanitarian\" relief and recovery assistance, but for heightened efforts to contain the wider effects of such massive shocks. Instead, most discussions of natural disasters are largely limited to a \"humanitarian\" focus on the most direct impacts.  Severity is measured by what we might call \"the four D's\": deaths, destruction, dislocation and disease in the immediate area.  (In poorer locations, the death rate from an earthquake or cyclone is generally much higher than in richer places, where economic damage is usually the more statistically-impressive consequence.)  But with the increased inter-dependence of the global economy, and of global markets and supply chains for food, petroleum and industrial components, we face the potential for major impacts on much wider populations.  We might call these \"the five C's\": chokepoints, cascades, catalysts, collapse and conflicts. While none of these examples alone may seem threatening to fundamental American security interests, each suggests potential scenarios by which local disasters (particularly in combination) could produce ever wider impacts that provoke protective, competitive reactions by major governments.  The world-wide failure of a major food crop from a new fungus, for example, could lead to localized famines, export cut-offs, hoarding, cartelized supply arrangements or investment \"red-lining\" that could stimulate new zones of instability, hostile alliances and populist pretexts for conflict.  Likewise, a global pandemic could create restrictive, even isolationist reactions that could severely strain the standard plans for global cooperation by international and national agencies.  ",

In 1927, Georges Lemaitre, a Belgian monk who, as part of his MIT Ph.D. thesis, independently derived the Freidmann cosmological solutions to general relativity, predicted the expansion of the Universe as described now by Hubble's law. He also noted that the age of the Universe was approximately the inverse of the Hubble constant, and suggested that Hubble's data and Slipher's data supported this conclusion. His work, published in a Belgium journal, was not initially widely read, but it did not escape the attention of Einstein who saw the work at a conference in 1927, and commented to Lemaitre, \"Your calculations are correct, but your grasp of physics is abominable\". In 1928, Robertson, at Caltech (just down the road from Edwin Hubble's office at the Carnegie Observatories), predicted the Hubble law, and claimed to see it when he compared Slipher's redshift versus Hubble's galaxy brightness measurements, but this observation was not substantiated. Finally, in 1929, Hubble presented a paper in support of an expanding universe, with a clear plot of galaxy distance versus redshift - it is for this paper that Hubble is given credit for discovering the expanding Universe. Assuming that the brightest stars he could see in a galaxy were all the same intrinsic brightness, Hubble found that the faster an object was moving away from Slipher's measurements, the fainter its brightest stars were. That is, the more distant the galaxy, the faster its speed of recession. It is from this relationship that Hubble inferred that the Universe was expanding. With the expansion of the Universe as an anchor, theory converged on a standard model of the Universe, which was still in place in 1998, at the time of our discovery of the accelerating Universe. ",

"text": "Plasticity refers to a capacity for change in response to positive or negative life experiences. Although we have described development as a continual and cumulative process and noted that past events often have implications for the future, developmentalists know that the course of development can change abruptly if important aspects of one's life change. For example, somber babies living in barren, understaffed orphanages often become quite cheerful and affectionate when placed in socially stimulating adoptive homes. Highly aggressive children who are intensely disliked by peers often improve their social status after learning and practicing the social skills that popular children display. It is indeed fortunate that human development is so plastic, for children who have horrible starts can often be helped to overcome their deficiencies. No single portrait of development is accurate for all cultures, social classes, or racial and ethnic groups. Each culture, subculture, and social class transmits a particular pattern of beliefs, values, customs, and skills to its younger generations, and the content of this cultural socialization has a strong influence on the attributes and competencies that individuals display. Development is also influenced by societal changes: historical events such as wars, technological breakthroughs such as the development of the Internet, and social causes such as the gay and lesbian rights movement. Each generation develops in its own way, and each generation changes the world for succeeding generations. So we should not automatically assume that developmental patterns observed in North American or European children (the most heavily studied populations) are optimal, or even that they characterize persons developing in other eras or cultural settings. Only by adopting a historical/cultural perspective can we fully appreciate the richness and diversity of human development. Let's look at the historical context of the science of human development in more detail.",

"text": "In the visual modality, such processing is often said to place demands on the transient channel, which may be subserved by the magnocellular system in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the dorsal visual stream in the cortex. In contrast, the sustained channel of the visual system involved in the perception of form or object properties appears less affected by the disorder. Backward-masking deficits in schizophrenia have sometimes been interpreted to be indicative of transient channel abnormalities, although processing speed and short-term memory disturbances may also contribute to these deficits. These visual deficits are consistent with positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies reporting hyperactivation of the visual cortex in response to photic stimulation in schizophrenia and neuropathological evidence of increased neuronal density in the occipital area 17.Visual short-term or working memory deficits have also been reported in schizophrenia. Working memory tasks typically require maintaining, and sometimes transforming, a neural representation for a brief period of time in order to carry out a task. Visual working memory, like perceptual processing, may be subserved by distinct anatomical regions. In primates and humans, the prefrontal lobes have been implicated in the performance of visual delayed response tasks, with activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during spatial memory tasks and the inferior frontal cortex during pattern memory tasks. On similar delayed spatial memory tasks, subjects with schizophrenia show marked impairments consistent with disturbances in prefrontal cortex working memory systems.Contrast sensitivity is the inverse of the contrast threshold (the minimum difference in luminance or brightness needed to reliably detect a stimulus). Contrast sensitivity, which can be affected by retinal or lateral geniculate abnormalities, has been reported to be impaired in schizophrenia. Contrast sensitivity was evaluated for each eye by using the Freiberg Acuity Test, which varies the contrast of a Landolt C optotype on a cathode ray tube display.",

"text": "Regarding the final prediction, several factors are likely to influence the degree to which an individual values collective outcomes relative to individual outcomes. Two especially prominent factors may be gender and culture. Recent gender research seems to suggest that women tend to be more group- or collectively-oriented than men. For example, research on gender stereotypes has demonstrated that men are expected to possess high levels of agentic qualities (such as being independent and assertive), whereas women are expected to possess high levels of communal qualities (such as being friendly, unselfish, and concerned with others). Similarly, research conducted in small-group settings has found that men tend to specialize in activity oriented toward task completion, whereas women tend to specialize in activity oriented toward meeting interpersonal demands within the group. Taken together, these findings suggest that men appear to be oriented toward individualistic and competitive concerns, whereas women appear to be oriented toward interpersonal and cooperative concerns. An extension of this logic to social loafing suggests that women are more likely than men to view performing well on collective tasks as important. Thus, we predicted that, although both sexes are likely to engage in social loafing, women should tend to loaf less than men. In a similar manner, the degree to which the dominant culture from which subject populations were selected emphasizes individualistic versus collectivistic concerns may moderate the social loafing effect. Eastern or Oriental culture is often depicted as group- or socially oriented, whereas Western or American culture is often depicted as individualistically oriented. Therefore, subjects from Eastern cultures are more likely to view performance on collective tasks as important than are subjects from Western cultures. Thus, we predicted that subjects in countries such as Japan, Taiwan, and China should loaf less than subjects in the United States and Canada ",

"text": "An inescapable social quality of increased involvement in an active movement is a sense of gradual progression. From examining accounts closely, increased commitment to the movement appears to be characterized by a slow marginalization away from conventional society and toward a much narrower society where extremism becomes all-encompassing. It is also characterized by a sense of increasing disillusionment with alternative avenues developing in conjunction with increasing involvement in peripheral activities. What constitutes an alternative avenue likely reflects a \"community of practice\" dimension identified by Hundeide as a necessary quality that the movement must put in place to solidify commitment by the individual member. Increased commitment and ever-greater and ever-focused involvement will carry with it the realization that in difficult or challenging times, the need to \"stick it out\" is paramount. Involvement encompasses constant change and vastly differing levels of activity, commitment, and overall involvement - all of which might be present in one small terrorist grouping. As McCauley and Segal memorably put it, at any one time, some members are \"beginning to find out . . . others are becoming committed, others are firmly committed, others becoming less committed, and still others are in the process of leaving entirely.\" We can see how profiling (based on conceptually dubious attempts to identify individual qualities of those filling certain specific roles) will be quite limited without a sense of the varied factors influencing how and why that role became attractive, open, and attainable for a specific individual moving through the terrorist group. What might determine the total extent of active members at any one time might relate to a whole host of local internal and external group, organizational, leadership, and other management or response issues. What is necessary from a counter perspective is a way of assessing capacity and threat or risk without having to revert to limited notions of counting membership based on restrictive and unrelated criteria.",

"text": "Longstaff provided a particularly thought-provoking treatment of the nature of the stressors confronted by systems and communities. She heavily emphasized the unpredictable nature of the dangers confronting contemporary planners. Our world is increasingly interconnected and complex, with systems in constant flux in reaction to changes in other systems, making surprise more common than predictability. Some dangers are familiar but unpredictable as to where or when they will happen (known unknowns), but some dangers are new: \"We don't know about and won't know about these until they happen\" (unknown unknowns). Longstaff used the concept of \"surprise\" to capture this discrepancy between what is expected and what is experienced. These surprises are nearly impossible to predict or prepare for, and thus call for broad resilience strategies. Do demands outweigh resources? The implied interaction has a long history in resilience theory and is extremely important in disaster theory. In fact, Quarantelli sought to remind us that the consequences of disasters follow not only from the needs of the community but from the community's capacity to meet those needs. It has become almost a cliche to note that crises bring opportunities for growth as well as risk for harm, as this idea has been with us for a long time. The ideal outcome afterwards is resistance, meaning that the resources have effectively blocked the stressor and, accordingly, there is virtually no dysfunction, no matter how temporary. Individuals benefit from resistance strategies on a daily basis, in that the human immune system is one of the most effective resistance strategies known to exist. Resistance strategies are appropriate for dangers that are likely to happen with some frequency and can be planned for, such as fires, but they are not likely to be fully effective against surprises ",

"text": "Indeed, humans can estimate a person's mental state by his/her facial expressions. This human ability is currently being applied for more effective and friendly methods in human computer interaction, which assume that information about a user's identity, state and intent can be extracted from images, and that computers can then react accordingly. Similar information can also be used in security control systems or in criminology to uncover possible criminals. The first step of a fully automated system that analyzes the information contained in face images is to detect and locate the faces in the images. Given a single image, the goal of face detection is to determine whether or not there are any faces in the image and, if so, return the location and extent of each face. After successful detection of the face, facial expression analysis must determine the psychological state of a person, so that the computer can react accordingly. The development of a fully automated facial expression analysis system, capable of classifying a person's facial expression without errors, is quite challenging, Some of the challenges that have to be addressed in developing such a system arise from the facts that faces are non-rigid and have a high degree of variability in size, shape, color and texture. Furthermore, variations in pose, image orientation and conditions add to the level of difficulty of the problem. Moreover, the variability in the ways people express themselves, depending on their culture, psychological state and habits, make it even more difficult to determine one's psychological condition through his/her face image. To address this problem, a number of works have appeared in the literature. Most of them preprocess the image to extract features of high discrimination power and use a classifier to determine the user's facial expression.",

"text": "We are born with instincts, which are an algorithmically programmable concept. These instincts include the ability to differentiate between people and objects, pointing, observation, and experimentation. We're also born with evolutionarily beneficial desires?and the instinct to cry when these desires are not met. This is very effective at the start of our lives, but as desires become more complex and we attain more understanding of the world, we discover that interaction can lead to more effective desire fulfillment (e.g. babies point to what they want). Interaction first requires perception of attention, which does not yet map easily to algorithms. We take 3-4 years to develop theory of mind: the understanding that one's consciousness is separate from everyone else's. Many children on the autistic spectrum struggle to fully develop theory of mind. Theory of mind leads to self-awareness, empathy, and an eventual understanding of all our social constructs. It is required for meaningful conversation among humans, and thus is critical for the Turing test. So how exactly is it learned? Humans develop theory of mind through observation and interaction. Through experimentation, babies discover that attention differs between people: baby sees something interesting, baby reacts, baby points, you look, you react. Rather than taking you as part of the environment, babies begin to develop a sense of agency. This is the key to unlocking theory of mind. A machine that starts with attention awareness and programmed instincts, put in a human environment and treated just as one, should theoretically develop theory of mind and social skills just as babies do. The machine learns agency and attention differentiation; it realizes that all agents have their own set of intentions; it learns through mimicry and becomes effective at fulfilling its goals. It picks up language and social skills. After these learnings, this conscious machine could pass the Turing test.",

"text": "This model focuses on the extent to which individuals are able to maintain social (e.g., family roles, work roles) and personal (e.g., possessions, sense of optimism) characteristics that can be employed to achieve reinforcing goals. The model labels these social and personal characteristics as resources. Resources, then, are tools employed by an individual in achieving desirable states. The COR model proposes that the loss or threatened loss of resources results in diminished coping capacity and psychological distress. Further, the model implies that replenishing diminished resources should enhance coping capacity and reduce psychological distress. The breadth of the COR model makes it useful in conceptualizing adjustment to natural disasters. The model identifies four resource categories: object resources--which are possessions with either functional or status value such as, car, home, household items; condition resources--which include a variety of social roles such as, employment, marriage, and membership in organizations; personal characteristic resources--which are self and world views such as, a sense of optimism, a sense of meaning/purpose, and feeling independent; and energy resources--such as time, money, and information, which are valued as tools in the acquisition of other resources. The COR model implies that natural disasters restrict coping options and produce psychological distress by producing loss within each resource category. Further, postdisaster interventions that target affected resources should enhance coping capacity and reduce psychological distress. The COR model proposes that the experience of resource loss is the primary factor in determining postdisaster psychological adjustment. It does not suggest, however, that the predisaster availability of resources (e.g., social support, money) or the postdisaster vulnerability to resource loss (e.g., loss of possessions, loss of employment) occurs randomly. Certain groups (e.g., single parents) may begin with fewer resources and remain more vulnerable to resource loss, coping impairment, and psychological distress following disasters or other stressful events.

"text": "Readiness to sacrifice for friends and family is so common that it is often seen as natural and no more in need of explanation than having two eyes. But sacrifices for non-kin present a more obvious puzzle. Why would Zazulich or Waagner, or anyone, make sacrifices in the interest of non-kin? For Waagner, the puzzle is even more pointed: why would he leave his family behind to become God's Warrior? One answer is called strong reciprocity. Among animals that live in groups, including humans, there are advantages to cooperation. A hunter who gets lucky today will benefit from sharing meat with the rest of the group - if he can expect to receive a share in the group's food supply on a less successful day. Sadly, the advantages of reciprocity can be reaped by cheaters - those who defect from cooperation, contributing no resources yet profiting by those who do. Over time, pure altruists in the group will lose out as more and more and more members take the easy route of doing less and getting more. Both animals and humans can solve this problem by punishing cheaters. A group that has members willing to carry out justice at a cost to themselves can afford the luxury, and reap the benefits, of altruism. Altruism can succeed if there are enough individuals who respond in kind - tit-for-tat - to both cooperation and cheating. Strong Reciprocity describes this combination of two tendencies, to cooperate and to punish non-cooperators. The combination can be successful where the tendency to cooperate, taken alone, would disappear under the costs of cheaters. Even in simple games, individuals are willing to pay personal costs to punish bad behavior that does not affect them personally. Punishing bad people - carrying out justice - becomes an expression of altruism no less than helping good people. ",
